<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I am a student at Lifechoices Academy studying to become a developer.Starting in a new field is a big chnge because I have to adjust as an individual.
I am a person who has many different hobbies and one of them is being "ONLINE".</p><p>In my free time i use it to skate and try new things to expand and get the best out of life because it so short.</p>
<p>My main and biggest qoutes is "DO WHAT EXCITES". What thi quote actually means is basically that if something make you happy but scares you at the same time , you might as well try it out.></p>
<p> Life is only as exciting as you make it</p>
